Welcome!
Welcome to Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python

Use pandas for data manipulation in data science workflows

Build your first data science web app with the Streamlit library in Python. By the end of this project, you are going to get comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive web apps with zero web development experience! We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code! 

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.

Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python.: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.

Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
